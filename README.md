# hello-world

Hello there!

This is my initial foray into the world of coding. I am looking to switch careers from a physical role in Construction to a career where I can help build the digital future with my mind instead. Apparently, neurodiverse people like me are good at this stuff, so I am exploring whether this is also the case for me. 

I am currently learning to code using the following resources:

freecodecamp.org - HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python <br>
PY4E - Python3 <br>
edX - CS50x 2021
